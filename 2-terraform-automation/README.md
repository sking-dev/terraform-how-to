## How to Use Git Pre-commit Hooks with Terraform IaC

As an IaC engineer, I'd like to use Git pre-commit hooks to validate my Terraform code client-side thereby avoiding the need to include validation tasks in my CI pipeline.

Check out this [step-by-step guide](Use-Git-Pre-Commit-Hooks-Terraform-IaC.md) to set off on this exciting journey (yeeha!)

## How to Set Up a GitOps CI/CD Pipeline

As an IaC engineer, I'd like to set up a CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps to support a GitOps-based approach to IaC deployments using Terraform.

Take a look at this [WIP guide](Set-Up-GitOps-CI-CD-Pipeline.md) to see where I've got to so far.

## How to Handle Merge Conflicts in a GitOps Workflow

As an IaC engineer, I'd like to make my GitOps workflow robust and scalable as possible by preventing merge conflicts or, when they do occur, by resolving them in a quick and efficient manner.

Check out my [somewhat subjective guide here](Handle-Merge-Conflicts-GitOps-Workflow.md).

## How to Incorporate Security Scanning into an IaC Deployment Pipeline

As an IaC engineer, I'd like to scan my Terraform code for any security misconfiguration issues and risks prior to merging and deploying any changes to my live environments.

Feast your eyes on my [evaluation and configuration notes here](Set-Up-Security-Scanning-IaC-Pipeline.md).

## How to Set Up a Pipeline with Runtime Parameters

As an IaC engineer, I'd like to be able to manually run a pipeline and deploy code based on parameters selected at runtime.

Have a gander at [the pipeline YAML files and configuration notes](/2-terraform-automation/pipeline-runtime-parameters/README.md)
